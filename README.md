The project's goal was to develop an item-tracking application for the Corner Grocer that scans text records of products purchased throughout the day to calculate item frequencies and generate histograms. Users may search up item frequencies, print item frequency lists, generate histograms, and store data to a backup file.

One of the code's strengths is its obvious organization and use of best practices. The usage of a class (ItemTracker) elegantly wraps the functionality, while the use of maps makes tracking item frequencies efficient. Furthermore, the menu-driven design makes navigation easy.

However, there is room for improvement. Input validation might be included to ensure robustness, preventing problems like incorrect user selections or non-existent item lookups. This would improve the program's usability while also preventing unexpected behavior. Additionally, error handling might be enhanced, with users receiving useful warnings when file operations fail.

The most difficult part of building the code might have been designing the histogram output. However, by breaking down the problem into smaller pieces and exploiting the map data structure, the solution became doable.

To expand my support network, I may look at other resources on C++ best practices and error handling approaches. This may include online lessons, documentation, or forums where I can get guidance from more experienced coders.
